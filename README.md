Challenges I had:Random number bug
At first, the random number would change after every guess. I had to fix it by generating the number only once when the game starts.

Input validation
Sometimes the app crashed when users entered text instead of a number. I had to add checks to make sure the input was a valid number.

Restart logic
Making the "play again" feature work properly took some time, especially resetting the state without errors.

User experience
I tried to make the messages easy to understand and friendly for all users.
